# **Spam-Classifier-Task**

## **About Task**
Weâ€™ll take a look at how we can transform our unstructured text data into something more useful for analysis and natural language processing, using the helpful Python packages.

### **My Approach :**
* First done with data analysis which includes - read data, checking table lenght, missing values, etc..
*  After data analysis, I have add few features to spice up the classification problem more exciting.
*  Used 2 differ Machine Learning algorithms to make comapring model selection.
*  Random Forest and XGBoost these alogrithms were used for comapring models, My final answer for model is Random Forest model on the basis of Precision accuracy who detect more spams as comapred to XGBoost model.
* To know the reason why I go with Random Forest model and why choose Precision, Kindly check my notebook.
